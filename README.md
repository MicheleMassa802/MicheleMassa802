# Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Michele!

I am a Computer Science Specialist who very recently graduated from the University of Toronto with the Computer Systems and Game Design foci.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer I at Zynga (under the Ad Monetization team), and I have previously worked on VR Research at the DGP Lab, at Zynga as a Software Engineering Intern, and at Ontario Parks as a Backend Intern.

### My Interests!

I am very passionate about Video Game and Web Development, especially at the Human-Computer-Interaction edge, as I strive to make software that makes interaction with a user either more practical or more fun.

### My Weapons of Choice:

- My daily drivers: 
    - C#: Unity and ASP.NET
    - Python: Django and ML models
    - Java: SpringBoot
    - PSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- Have experience with:
    - GoLang: gRPC APIs
    - JS/TS: React and React Native
    - C++: Cuda
    - Razor Pages

### My Projects:

I'm proud of all of my projects below as they represent a different stage in my career path (out of the ones I am allowed to show). If you don't want to go to each repo and instead just watch some of their demos, just go [here](https://www.youtube.com/@michelemassa3029)!

Feel free to check out the full public projects below, and some of my more video-game-oriented ones [on this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNY4nzwiH7-U_DMgfBbk8gdwijGCDmaz?usp=sharing) consisting of the projects I worked on while learning Unity.
